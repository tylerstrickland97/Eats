# <center>CSC 342 - Project Proposal</center>
<strong>Authors:</strong> Tyler Strickland, Kayna Henningham, Collin Riggs<br>
<strong>Mission:</strong> We plan to build an app that solves the problem of finding information related to restaurants all in one place.<br>

## Problem
When trying to find the perfect place to eat at for your next meal, there are several factors that influence what restaurant a person might choose. Is the restaurant close enough? Does it serve the type of food I want? Is it too pricey? Does it fit my nutritional needs? These are all questions that a person might ask about a restaurant that they are considering dining at. Finding all this information about restaurants can be a bother because it usually is not in one place. But, our app _Eats_ solves this problem. With this app, anyone will be able to access any desired information related to the restaurant of their choosing. A user can find restaurants within a certain location, browse the menu for a restaurant, and more. By using this app, a user can stop spending lots of time hopping from website to website to find different information related to one restaurant.

## Features
_Eats_ will offer several features for a user. First, a user will be able to view restaurants by using different filters. They can filter restaurants by location, types of food served, and rating. This will allow users to get a general idea of what restaurant they might want to consider for their next meal. Our app will also allow a user to view the menu of any restaurant they select. The user will be able to view the menu and see what dishes each restaurant has to offer. Besides the menu, the user will be able to view nutritional information for a restaurant which will help them determine if that restaurant fits their dietary needs. Our app doesn’t only allow a user to simply view this information. It also allows a user to save restaurants to a list of “favorites”, which will let them quickly view this information again in the future. This adds to the already convenient information portal our app provides.

## Data
In order for _Eats_ to work correctly, we will need to find a way to retrieve the information for each restaurant, preferably through some API. So far, the team has found a few potential sources for this data, but more research will need to be conducted in order to determine whether these APIs have all of the information needed to implement all of our desired features. If such APIs do not exist, the team may have to manually import the data in order for our app to work as expected.

## Individual Contributions
For the project proposal Tyler proposed the idea of creating a restaurant information app, which was used by the team as a foundation of the project idea. He also created a draft of the formal proposal that the team then further expanded on. He will also bring web development experience from CSC 326 to the team. From taking the course, he is familiar with APIs and has a good understanding of the web development process in general. Besides technical skills, he will also bring a positive attitude and a good work ethic to the team. 

For the project proposal Collin created the mobile wireframe and formatted the project proposal into markdown. For the future of the project he will use his experience from CSC 326 to help set up a REST API and a database to store user information.

Kayna will bring front and back end experience from CSC 326 and personal projects, and she has began research on restaurant APIs to use for this project. She understands the web development process and knows many different languages that support its development. For development, she will bring her previous experience and new ideas to flesh out for the restaurant app.
